## About Me
I am 31 yars old. I have been working at a rocket engine factory for 9 years as an engineer.
Two months ago I took introductory courses at Yandex on frontend development and now I don't see my future without it.
I believe that learning a new specialty will open up new opportunities for me! I am a very responsible person, quick learner and team player.
